# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  The purpose of this new analysis was to use Python and Pandas to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. In addition, we used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  This analysis allows us to see how the data differs by city type on a weekly basis and inform decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
   As you can see from the output of the Pyber_Challenge report - PyBer_Challenge.ipynb, the ride-sharing data differs greatly among the different city types. The total rides, total drivers, total fares, and average fare per ride and driver were measured. It was interesting to note that each city type follows a similar trejectory of increases and decreases in total fares throughout the year - analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png. 
### Total Fares
  The multiple-line chart shows that total fares per week were significantly lower in rural cities, approximately $500 higher in suburban cities, and over $1000 higher in urban areas during certain months of the year.
### Total Drivers
   The amount of total drivers for each city type varied in a similar way.  Rural cities had far fewer drivers at 125 total. Suburban cities had exactly 500 more drivers and urban cities had 1,000 more than suburban with 1625 total drivers. 
### Total Rides
   The difference in total rides was more dramatic.  Rural cities had a very low ride count at 78.  Suburan cities have about 400 more with 490 total rides.  Urban cities were significantly higher than both with 2,405 rides.
### Average Fare per Ride
   The average fare per ride showed the smallest difference between cities. Rural cities are the lowest at $24 but suburban cities are only about $5 higher and urban cities are $10 higher at $34.
### Average Fare per Driver
   The average fare per driver showed a more significant difference.  Rural cities were still very low at $16 per driver, suburban cities were over $10 more at $39 per driver and urban cities were almost $15 higher at $55.
   
## Summary 
  Based on these results,including the visual representation between the city types, it is my recommendation attempt to close the gap in disparities between the city types. Possibly increasing the number of drivers in rural areas (if the population supports this), raising fares in rural areas to get closer to a mean fare value between the 3 city types, and possibly set guidelines for more universal fares so that the difference among drivers and city types isn't as dramatic. In conclusion, using Pandas and Matplotlib to calculate weekly numbers and create a multi-line chart for a visual representation of the data is an excellent way to organize and view this data and any other data types that may need to be analyzed.
